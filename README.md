# DecisionTree-classification-Model

Problem statement: Suppose we are lost in a forest, and are very hungry. Unable to go on without eating something first, we take a look around, only to find nothing immediately edible -- just mushrooms. We're starving, so anything looks great to us, but eating one of those carelessly might result in us getting poisoned. To know if we can or cannot eat a mushroom, we need to classify it based on our knowledge of its features.

Our classifier model will predict the mushroom's edibility based upon various attributes of the mushroom like cap-shape, odour, stalk type of the mushroom etc. For simplicity we use 'p' for poisonous and 'e' for edible type of mushrooms.
